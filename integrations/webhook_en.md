# Webhook
inline can send webhook events to a specified http endpoint.

# Spec
webhook events are sent through Http POST, and in application/json:
```
{
  "timestamp": 1524181344796,
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "event-type",
      "data": {
        // depend on event type
      },
      "timestamp": 1524181344796
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
## Security
inline uses `X-Hub-Signature` to ensure webhook security. Please refer to https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/ for verifying the data from webhook is trustable or not.
